## AI Agents

This repository provides three AI-powered agents designed to streamline workflows for XSIAM on Google Vertex:

1. **SPL to XQL Converter**  
    Accepts a SPL (Search Processing Language) query and automatically translates it into an equivalent XQL (XSIAM Query Language) statement, enabling seamless migration and interoperability between platforms.

2. **Data Source Documentation Generator**  
    Given a data source name, this agent generates a comprehensive change or implementation document. It outlines integration steps, configuration details, and best practices for onboarding new data sources into XSIAM.

3. **Raw Log to Data Model Rule Generator**  
    Processes raw log samples and produces XSIAM data model rules. This helps automate the creation of parsing and normalization rules, accelerating the mapping of logs to XSIAMâ€™s standardized data models.

Each agent is designed to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy in security operations workflows.
